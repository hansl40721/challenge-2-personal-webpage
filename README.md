# challenge-2-personal-webpage
This week we were challenged to create a landing page for a personal porfolio, where we could display and host links to our projects. We were tasked with creating the HTML structure of the website and style it using our new knowledge of CSS. Below are a link to and a screenshot of the deployed application.
